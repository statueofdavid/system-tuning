# system-tuning
got a machine from joaks and well figured I drop my tuning ramblings in a repo... not really sure if this is because I am just trying to hit my daily commit goals or if dropping system configurations is a good idea

so after some research, I think the best place to get started is (BDdddddddddddddddd)... the Linux Namespaces API.  Here is a list of them:
1. cgroup
2. IPC
3. Net
4. Mnt
5. User
6. UTS

This feels like a big idea and for those know me this is typical. With that said, I have unknowingly used them and now that I have some decent consumer horsepower, albeit circa 2014/2015 compute, I believe I should explore them intentionally while I attempt to build a system that can handle several game servers initialList(Minecraft, Terarria, ARK:Survival, Rust?, CoreKeeper?, GarrysMod?), and some devops build server action for my projects of feverish delusion (useful, declared_space, soundz_from_da_bog, yage, and chaos).

... this is yet another one of my project ideas (yaoompi) ...

hoping this one happens though 'cause, at the time of this writing, I believe this is the one to the unlock the rest (tottutr) :^)
